# Bangkit Academy Projects

### Projects in Bangkit Academy
This repository contains various projects that I have worked on during my time at Bangkit Academy. These projects cover different domains and utilize open-source files and datasets available on the internet.

Please note that the majority of the files used in the projects are open source and can be found online. However, for the capstone project, it includes a survey conducted by our team, and the data used for the model development is not publicly available. If you intend to use the capstone data for your own models or research, please provide proper citation and attribution by referencing my GitHub repository.

Feel free to explore the projects and dive into the code and documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy exploring!
